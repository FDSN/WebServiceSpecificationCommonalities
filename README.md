The [International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN)](https://www.fdsn.org/)
defines web service interfaces that provide access to data and metadata
in seismology.  These services share many common characterisitics which
are defined in a specification "Commonalities" document.

The Commonalities and service specifications are published at:
https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/ and maintained by 
[FDSN Working Group III](https://www.fdsn.org/wg/wgIII/).

This repository is used to tracking issues and suggestions (and their
related conversation) related to the Commonalities.
